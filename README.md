### Hey There! 👋

My name is Alex Ricardo and I develop websites and applications. I'm addicted and passionate about codes! I've been designing and coding on the web since 2017.

I usually work with front-end technology like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I love working with React.JS frameworks.

I enjoy solving problems(🤔), playing video games(⚡), watching series(🎞️), playing sports(⚽️), traveling, socializing(💬) and programming(🧑🏼‍💻)!
